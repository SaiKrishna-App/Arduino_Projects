Arduino Uno LED Connections

Hardware Connections:

Red LED (Pin 13):
Anode (long leg) to digital pin 13
Cathode (short leg) to a 220-330 ohm resistor
Resistor to GND

Yellow LED (Pin 12):

Anode to digital pin 12
Cathode to a 220-330 ohm resistor
Resistor to GND

Green LED (Pin 11):

Anode to digital pin 11
Cathode to a 220-330 ohm resistor
Resistor to GND

Red LED (Pin 10):
Anode to digital pin 10
Cathode to a 220-330 ohm resistor
Resistor to GND

Yellow LED (Pin 9):

Anode to digital pin 9
Cathode to a 220-330 ohm resistor
Resistor to GND

Green LED (Pin 8):

Anode to digital pin 8
Cathode to a 220-330 ohm resistor
Resistor to GND

Notes

Ensure proper orientation of LEDs (anode to Arduino pin, cathode to resistor).
Use a USB cable to power the Arduino Uno.
